Many of the Twitter users publicly tweet about their mental health condition on the website.
For instance, there are many tweets with the following content in it: "I'm diagnosed with depression" or "I have been diagnosed with PTSD", etc.

Many of the Twitter users also tweet about their musical taste by tweeting a link to a music streaming platform, e.g. Spotify, AppleMusic, Soundcloud,
on the website. It is a common practice and sometimes they use a hashtag with it. #np and #nowplaying are two of the widely used hashtags when Twitter users
tweet about a music they are listening to.

In order to study and analyze the musical taste of Twitter users with self-disclosed diagnosis of mental disorders, and also to study the relationship
between the musical taste and the mental disorders, I dug the public Twitter database from 01/01/2018 to 04/01/2021 (January) to retrieve a list of
such users.

To further investigate and perform comparison study, I gathered a similar dataset of tweets and musics from "control" Twitter users, i.e. Twitter users
who have never tweeted anything about mental disorders.
